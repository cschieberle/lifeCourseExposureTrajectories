Description: This package supports the estimation of individual or population
    life trajectories based on socio-economicm specifics, gender, age etc. It make
    heavy use of the TraMineR package do estimate trajectories of life based on
    statistics of income and living conditions. Combining the life trajectories
    with time-use/time-activity patterns and information on location and individual
    habits allows for an estimation of exposure to multiple stressors specific to
    the situation in a certain stage of life. The package was developed in the scope
    of the HEALS project at IER, University of Stuttgart.
